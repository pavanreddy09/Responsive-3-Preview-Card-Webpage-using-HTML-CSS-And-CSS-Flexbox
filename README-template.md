I learned how to use @media query to view ouput in mobile device and desktop.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
 @media (max-width:600px) {
      .container {
            flex-direction: column;
            width: auto;
            margin-top: 0;
      }
      .attribution { 
      margin-top: 2rem;
      }
    }
    @media (max-width:375px) {
      .container {
            flex-direction: column;
            width: auto;
            margin-top: 0;
      }
      .attribution { 
      margin-top: 2rem;
      }
    }
```
